# HereWeGo

HereWeGo is a cross platform hosts file manager.

Have you run into such an occassion where you have to change your hosts file with SO MANY steps? Think about Windows! Mac and Linux are a little better, yet not that much.

[gas Mask](https://github.com/2ndalpha/gasmask) is now my favorite hosts file manager but it has a few disadvantages too. I have no enough knowledge about Mac OS X development and I want this App to be cross platform. So I chose Python and Qt.

Schedule:

1. Single host file editing
2. Multiple host files merge to one before take action
3. Sequence support for multiple host files
4. Syntax checking and hightlighting

TODO maybe:

1. Elegent widgets of notification
